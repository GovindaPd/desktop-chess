Welcome to the immersive world of desktop chess, where the age-old game meets cutting-edge technology! Designed using the powerful combination of Python programming language and the Tkinter GUI framework,
this chess game offers a seamless and intuitive user experience.

*** Algorithm ***
At its core, this chess game is powered by two formidable algorithms: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning. 
These algorithms are the brain behind the AI opponent you'll face, ensuring that every move it makes is calculated to maximize its chances of victory while minimizing potential losses.

But that's not all. Unlike many other chess games, where third-party modules are used for move generation, this game takes it a step further. 
The legal move generator is crafted entirely using logic within the Python codebase. 
This means that every move the AI considers is generated organically within the game itself, without relying on external libraries or modules.

Here's what you can expect from this desktop chess game:

Sleek User Interface: The Tkinter GUI provides a sleek and responsive interface, allowing you to focus entirely on the game without distractions. 
                      The minimalist design ensures that the spotlight remains on the chessboard and the strategic decisions that unfold upon it.

Challenging AI Opponent: Prepare yourself for a battle of wits against an AI opponent that's been honed by the powerful Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms. 
                         Each move is meticulously calculated, ensuring a challenging and engaging experience every time you play.

Native Move Generation: With the legal move generator built directly into the game's logic, you can rest assured that every move adheres to the rules of chess with precision and accuracy. 
                        Whether you're a beginner learning the ropes or a seasoned player seeking a worthy adversary, you can trust that the moves generated by the AI are grounded in the fundamental principles of the game.
